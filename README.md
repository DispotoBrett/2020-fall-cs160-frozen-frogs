##  1. <a name='BuildPrerequisites'></a>Build Prerequisites:
- Python 3.5+ installed

- Python [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) installed 

- bash or zsh 

- MySQL 8

##  2. <a name='Buildingthedevenvironment'></a>Building the dev environment

- Clone the repository

- Change to the `backend/` directory and run the command: `source install.sh`. This will do three things:
	1. Creates the python virtual environment if it doesn't exist 
	2. activates the virtual environment for your shell session 
	3. installs the app dependencies via `pip` from the `requirements.txt` file.

##  3. <a name='Databasesetup'></a>Database setup

Ubuntu 20.04
- Ensure you have the latest pip dependencies and are on the project venv
- install the following (Ubuntu 20.04):
	- `mysql-client`
	- `mysql-server`
	- `libmysqlclient-dev`
	- `python3-dev`
- First, you'll probably want to delete all the migrations in `backend/app/migrations` if there is any. These were not meant to be shared among team members but this was an oversight in the inital design.
- run `/etc/init.d/mysql start`
- run `sudo mysql_secure_installation`
- Follow the prompt. Allow the least secure options available. Don't remove anon users. Don't disable remote root login.
- Login to mysql as root "sudo mysql -u root -p', enter your password
- Run the script following script AS ROOT! `/database/scripts/init-db.sh`
	- This will create a user `frogs`
	- Sets the password to `frogs`
	- Creates a database named `frogs`
	- The script will likley prompt you for your mysql root passsword you set earlier. ABOUT 4 times, so just keep  typing it.
	- Feel free to do this by hand. Just make sure the credentals match up.
    - You might want to run the sqldump script provided in `/database/scripts/loadBooks.sql` to populate with some books
      for a demo.
- Run `python manage.py migrate` to migrate the existing django services to the new database
- Run `python manage.py makemigrations app` and `python manage.py migrate` again to put the models in the database
- Verify everything worked. Your mysql database frogs should be populated
- You can now play around with the database API django made for us.
    - Run `python manage.py shell`
    - Once in the shell `from app.models import Posting`
    - Then you can test commands such as `Posting.objects.All()` see the [django database api reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/queries/) for more info.
    - Django has also has a nice explanation of the ORM [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial02/)

##  4. <a name='Databasemigrations'></a>‚ö† Database migrations ‚ö†
If something gets severely messed up or you just want to start with a fresh database:
- `drop` your frogs database
- Delete all the migrations  `rm -rf /backend/app/migrations/*`
- rerun the init db script
- Make sure you're on the venv, as with everythign else we do
- `./manage.py makemigrations`
- `./manage.py migrate`
- Make sure the above worked, then continue below
- `./manage.py makemigrations app`
- `./manage.py migrate`

Upon database schema changes, you'll have to do the following, maybe.
Warning: this will delete the data in your tables. 
- Make sure you have the latest version of the app. You must run `source install.sh` from `/backend`, because this procedure invovles using the `django-extensions` addon
- `python manage.py reset_db --router=default`
- `python manage.py makemigrations`
- `python manage.py migrate`

if you need the app specific tables, youc can run
- `python manage.py migrate app`

If you dont want to lose your data, upon any change to the models, you can try the following, but it will likley cause more issues:
- `python manage.py makemigrations`
- `python manage.py migrate --fake app`
- When django asks, try to allow a None value in a new field

##  5. <a name='DockerSetup'></a>Docker Setup üê≥
- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- After installing, you will have access to the docker command line utility, `docker`
- For this project, we will be using Docker Compose, which is a way to streamline running multiple Docker containers from a single config file, docker-compose.yml
- To build and run the docker-compose.yml file, navigate to the project directory and run `docker-compose up -d --build`
- The above command will build the container images as well as run them in the background (-d option specifies detached mode)
- To start and stop the containers, you can use `docker-compose stop` and `docker-compose start`

###  5.1. <a name='DockerCLIQuickReference'></a>Docker CLI Quick Reference
- To display all containers on your system run `docker ps -a`
- To log in to one of your containers run `docker exec -it <container_name> /bash`
- NOTE: Not all containers use the same shell executable. Above we used bash, but depending on the container image, it may be different.

###  5.2. <a name='ConfiguredContainersdocker-compose.yml'></a>Configured Containers (docker-compose.yml)
- MySQL container with env options specified in `database/mysql.env`

##  6. <a name='Runindevelopmentmode'></a>Run in development mode:
To run the django app in deveopment mode:
- Change to the `backend/` directory

- run `python manage.py runserver`

- navigate to `localhost:8000` in your broswer

##  7. <a name='Deploy'></a>Deploy
To deploy the application on an apache web server:
- install and configure both `apache2` and `apache2-dev` (on debian and ubuntu) or equivalent packages

- (Follow the instructions on installing and configuring [mod_wsgi](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/). It will invovle installing a few packages and messing with a few config files. 

##  8. <a name='Notes'></a>Notes
- The django admin username and password are both `frogs`
- Create an admin account by running `python manage.py createsuperuser` and following the prompt

##  9. <a name='Defaultconfigurations'></a>Default Configurations
- By default, there will be 5 books loaded into the tables with negative PKs
	- These are for demo purposes.
- There will also be 2 demo users you can login as:
	1. Username: DemoSeller
	2. Username: DemoBuyer
	- The password for both is 'sjsu' (no quotes)
	
##  10. <a name='RegressionTests'></a>Regression Tests
- The system-level automated tests use the following tools:
	- `npm` and `node` for most things
	- `mocha` for the test framework
	- `selenium` for remote webdriver 
	- `msedgewebdriver` for controlling microsoft edge
- The tests themselves are in 	`/test-automation/tests/all.test.js`
- There are several node modules in `/test-automation/pages/`. The each provide a factory function for page-object-model (POM) pages/objects. Below is a architectual diagram of the POM model. ![Pom model](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*Uz0xBEbnd7IhEubY392Cow.png)
